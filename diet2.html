        <h2>BREAKFAST</h2>
        <h3>Start your day with a glass of warm water with lemon</h3>
        <h7>Glass of Warm Water with Lemon: Starting it can help hydrate the body and provide a boost of vitamin C from
          the lemon. It's a refreshing and low-calorie way to kickstart your morning.</h7>
        <h3>Have a balanced breakfast with whole grains, fruits, and protein</h3>
        <h7>Balanced Breakfast with Whole Grains, Fruits, and Protein: A balanced breakfast provides essential
          nutrients, energy, and helps maintain stable blood sugar levels throughout the morning. Whole grains offer
          fiber and sustained energy, fruits provide vitamins and minerals, and protein helps keep you full and
          satisfied.</h7>
        <h3>Include some healthy fats like avocado or nuts in your breakfast</h3>
        <h7>Include Healthy Fats like Avocado or Nuts: Healthy fats are essential for overall health and can contribute
          to satiety. Avocado and nuts are good sources of healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals.</h7>
        <h3>Avoid sugary cereals and pastries</h3>
        <h7>Avoid Sugary Cereals and Pastries: Sugary cereals and pastries often provide empty calories and can cause a
          spike in blood sugar levels followed by a crash, leading to hunger and cravings later in the day. Opting for
          whole foods instead helps maintain energy levels and promotes better overall health.</h7>

          colors. This ensures you get a diverse range of nutrients and antioxidants to support overall health.</h7>

        <h7>Incorporate Lean Protein Sources: Incorporate lean protein sources such as grilled chicken, fish, tofu, or
          legumes into your lunch. Protein helps build and repair tissues and keeps you feeling full and satisfied.</h7>
        <h3>Add Complex Carbohydrates</h3>
        <h7>Add Complex Carbohydrates: Add complex carbohydrates like brown rice, quinoa, or whole grain bread to your
          lunch. These carbohydrates provide sustained energy and are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals.</h7>

        <h3>Opt for a light dinner with lean protein, vegetables, and whole grains</h3>
        <h7>Opt for a Light Dinner: Choose a light dinner consisting of lean protein, vegetables, and whole grains. This

        <h3>Avoid heavy and greasy foods in the evening</h3>
        <h7>Avoid Heavy and Greasy Foods: Steer clear of heavy and greasy foods in the evening, as they can lead to

        <h3>Limit late-night snacking</h3>
        <h7>Limit Late-Night Snacking: Try to avoid late-night snacking, as it can interfere with your body's natural
          sleep-wake cycle and lead to weight gain. If you're hungry, opt for a small, healthy snack like fruit or
          yogurt.</h7>
        <h3>Stay hydrated with water or herbal tea</h3>
        <h7>Stay Hydrated: Stay hydrated throughout the evening by drinking water or herbal tea. Proper hydration
