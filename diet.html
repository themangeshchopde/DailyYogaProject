                    <h3>HEALTHY BREAKFAST</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Glass of Warm Water with Lemon:Starting it can help hydrate the body and provide a boost of
                            vitamin C from the lemon. It's a refreshing and low-calorie way to kickstart your morning.
                        </li>
                        <li>Balanced Breakfast with Whole Grains, Fruits, and Protein:A balanced breakfast provides
                            essential nutrients, energy, and helps maintain stable blood sugar levels throughout the
                            morning. Whole grains offer fiber and sustained energy, fruits provide vitamins and
                            minerals, and protein helps keep you full and satisfied.</li>
                        <li>Include Healthy Fats like Avocado or Nuts: Healthy fats are essential for overall health and
                            can contribute to satiety. Avocado and nuts are good sources of healthy fats, vitamins, and
                            minerals.</li>
                        <li>Avoid Sugary Cereals and Pastries: Sugary cereals and pastries often provide empty calories
                            and can cause a spike in blood sugar levels followed by a crash, leading to hunger and
                            cravings later in the day. Opting for whole foods instead helps maintain energy levels and
                            promotes better overall health.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Include a Variety of Vegetables: Aim to include a variety of vegetables in your lunch,
                            focusing on different colors. This ensures you get a diverse range of nutrients and
                            antioxidants to support overall health.</li>

                            fish, tofu, or legumes into your lunch. Protein helps build and repair tissues and keeps you
                            feeling full and satisfied.</li>
                        <li>Add Complex Carbohydrates:Add complex carbohydrates like brown rice, quinoa, or whole grain
                            bread to your lunch. These carbohydrates provide sustained energy and are rich in fiber,
                            vitamins, and minerals.</li>
                        <li>Stay Hydrated:Don't forget to stay hydrated by drinking water or unsweetened beverages with
                            your lunch. Proper hydration supports digestion, nutrient absorption, and overall
                            well-being.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Opt for a Light Dinner: Choose a light dinner consisting of lean protein, vegetables, and
                            whole grains. This combination provides essential nutrients while being easier to digest in
                            the evening.</li>
                        <li>Avoid Heavy and Greasy Foods: Steer clear of heavy and greasy foods in the evening, as they
                            can lead to discomfort and disrupt sleep. Opt for lighter options to promote better
                            digestion and restful sleep.</li>
                        <li>Limit Late-Night Snacking: Try to avoid late-night snacking, as it can interfere with your
                            body's natural sleep-wake cycle and lead to weight gain. If you're hungry, opt for a small,
                            healthy snack like fruit or yogurt.</li>
                        <li>Stay Hydrated: Stay hydrated throughout the evening by drinking water or herbal tea. Proper
